# LinearEquations
There are two methods to solve system of linear equations.
A system of linear equations can be represented as a $n\times(n+1)$ matrix A|b.
It can be solved to a $n$ dimension vector as the result.

## Method
### 1. The Gauss Elimination with Pivoting Method
### 2. The Jacobi Iteration Method

Look 'IterativeSolutionTest.cpp' file for examples.
